## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

packages required:
```{r}
install.packages('corrplot')

```


This chunk will generate a function that is used to generate a TC vector 

```{r}
# Boxcar function to generate TC Vectors 

boxcar <- function(start, arrival, duration, n) {
  
  # all zero vector 
  TC <- replicate(n, 0)
  
  # create arrival sequence vector
  arrivals <- seq(start+1, n, by=arrival)
  
  # change 0s to 1s for certain intervals based on arrival and duration
  for(i in arrivals) {
    TC[i:(i+duration-1)] <- 1

  }
  return(TC)
}



```


Generate TC Matrix based on set vectors, standardize this matrix for mean 0 
and sd 1

```{r}
# given quantities 
n <- 240
AV <- c(0, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0)
IV <- c(30, 45, 60, 40, 40, 40)
duration <- c(15, 20, 25, 15, 20, 25)


# generate TC Matrix  
for(i in 1:length(AV)) {
  if(i == 1) {
    TC <- boxcar(AV[1], IV[1], duration[1], n)
  }
  else {
    nextTC <- boxcar(AV[i], IV[i], duration[i], n)
    TC <- matrix(c(TC, nextTC), nrow = n, ncol = i)
  }
}

# standardize TC Matrix 

scaledTC <- scale(TC)
colnames(scaledTC) <- c("TC1", "TC2", "TC3", "TC4", "TC5", "TC6")


```
