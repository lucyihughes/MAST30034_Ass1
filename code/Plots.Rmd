## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

libraries required
```{r}
library(corrplot)

```


Generate plot from standardized TC Matrix 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pdf("../plots/TCMatrix.pdf", width = 12, height = 7)

# set up 2 x 3 plots 
par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) 

x <- 1:n
for(i in 1:length(AV)) {
  plot(x, scaledTC[, i], type = "l", main = paste("TC ", i), ylab = "y")
}
```

Generate correlation matrix output and plot based on TC Matrix
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# plot numeric correlation

corrMatrix <- cor(scaledTC)

pdf("../plots/corr_external_data.pdf")
correlation <- corrplot(corrMatrix, method = 'shade', order = 'AOE')
correlation
dev.off()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
