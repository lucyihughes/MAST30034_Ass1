# Directory
_Change this to fit your needs when you have started the project._
- `plots`: Output and save all your figures here.
- `code`: Keep all notebooks and scripts in this folder. Ensure that you have notebooks for each _stage_ of code. Here's an example:
    - Notebook 1 for "Synthetic Dataset Generation".
    - Notebook 2 for "Preprocessing" and/or "Exploratory Data Analysis".
    - Notebook 3 for "Analysis and Visualisation".
    - Notebook 4 for "Statistical Modelling".
- `deprecated`: A folder to store "old code" that **you do not use anymore** or code that you experimented with, but decided to not go ahead. This is useful in case you ever need to come back to an older iteration of code or to express your other approaches to the problem.
